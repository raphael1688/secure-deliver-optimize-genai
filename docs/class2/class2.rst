What You’ll Learn in This Lab
-----------------------------
In this lab, you will learn how to:

..  image:: ./_static/class2-0-0.png

1. Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller with App Protect to protect Web Apps Server
2. Deploy Arcadia Financial Modern Apps
3. Secure Modern Apps with NGINX App Protect WAF



1 - Deploy Nginx Ingress Controller with App Protect to protect Web Apps Server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

..  image:: ./_static/class2-0.png

After login/putty to linux Jumphost (from Windows11 Jumphost), change directory to **ai-apps**. Jumphost server was installed with utilities called 'direnv' - https://direnv.net/. Its a tools that will load the environment file (kubeconfig) when you switch to that directory. Its an efficient tools to switch K8S context from one cluster to the other just by changing directory.

.. NOTE::
       Refer to **Prerequsite** section to find the password for the Windows11 and Linux Jumphost (ssh session).
       
       Majority of the CLI will be executed from Linux Jumphost (ssh session) and/or Browser activites from Windows11 Jumphost.


.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ai-apps


.. code-block:: bash

     kubectl get node


.. code-block:: bash

     kubectl get po -A


..  image:: ./_static/class2-1.png


Execute the following command to install NGINX Ingress controller with the provided helm chart.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ai-apps/nginx-ingress

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl create ns nginx-ingress

.. code-block:: bash

   helm -n nginx-ingress install nginxic \
   oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-ingress -f values-plus-nap.yaml --version 1.4.0

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n nginx-ingress get pod,svc


..  image:: ./_static/class2-2.png

.. Note:: 
   Please note that the purpose of this lab is not to provide a comprehensive guide for installing the NGINX Ingress Controller for AppProtect. Instead, it focuses on setting up a basic infrastructure to secure, deliver, and optimize GenAI applications. For detailed configuration best practices, please refer to the official documentation.

   **values-plus-nap.yaml** is the modified values file for nginx-ingress helm chart. There were few variables being updated for this deployment.

values-plus-nap.yaml ::

   appprotect:
    ## Enable the App Protect WAF module in the Ingress Controller.
    enable: true

   image:
    ## The image repository of the Ingress Controller.
    repository: reg.ai.local/ngx/nginx-plus-nap-ingress

    ## The tag of the Ingress Controller image. If not specified the appVersion from Chart.yaml is used as a tag.
    tag: "3.7.0"

    ## It is recommended to use your own TLS certificates and keys
    defaultTLS:
      ## The base64-encoded TLS certificate for the default HTTPS server.
      ## Note: It is recommended that you specify your own certificate. Alternatively, omitting the default server   secret completely will configure NGINX to reject TLS connections to the default server.
      cert: "xxxxxxx"
  
    ## The base64-encoded TLS key for the default HTTPS server.
      ## Note: It is recommended that you specify your own key. Alternatively, omitting the default server secret   completely will configure NGINX to reject TLS connections to the default server.
      key: "xxxxxxx"
  
    wildcardTLS:
      ## The base64-encoded TLS certificate for every Ingress/VirtualServer host that has TLS enabled but no   secret specified.
      ## If the parameter is not set, for such Ingress/VirtualServer hosts NGINX will break any attempt to   establish a TLS connection.
      cert: "xxxxxxx"
  
      ## The base64-encoded TLS key for every Ingress/VirtualServer host that has TLS enabled but no secret   specified.
      ## If the parameter is not set, for such Ingress/VirtualServer hosts NGINX will break any attempt to   establish a TLS connection.
      key: "xxxxxxx" 



2 - Deploy Arcadia Financial Modern Apps
----------------------------------------

..  image:: ./_static/class2-3-0.png

Deploy Arcadia Financial application on Kubernetes. Arcadia Trading consist of multiple microservices.

- frontend
- backend
- money transfer
- refer friends


.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ai-apps/arcadia

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl create ns arcadia

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f frontend/

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f backend/

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f money-transfer/


.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f refer-friends/


..  image:: ./_static/class2-3.png


.. Note:: 
   Ensure all pods are in **Running** and **READY** state where all pods count ready before proceed.


.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia get pod,svc


..  image:: ./_static/class2-3-1.png

Create an Nginx ingress resource to **expose the Arcadia frontend service** externally from the Kubernetes cluster.

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f  arcadia-ai-local-ingress.yaml


.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia get ingress


..  image:: ./_static/class2-4.png

Confirm that you can access to Arcadia Financial modern apps from the Jumphost.

..  image:: ./_static/class2-5.png

Login to the Arcadia Financial with the following credential

+----------------+---------------+
| **Username**   | olivia        |
+----------------+---------------+
| **Password**   | ilovef5       |
+----------------+---------------+

..  image:: ./_static/class2-6.png

Able to login to Arcadia Financial trading page

..  image:: ./_static/class2-7.png

.. Note:: 
   This is a basic Arcadia Financial Trading page **WITHOUT** GenAI Chatbot. We will enhance this apps to include GenAI chatbot and secure the chatbot in subsequent class.

3 - Secure Modern Apps with NGINX App Protect WAF
-------------------------------------------------

Apply NGINX App Protect WAF rules and update Nginx ingress resource to protect Arcadia Financial Trading apps.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/ai-apps/arcadia

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f waf-policy-base-v2.yaml

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl -n arcadia get appolicy,aplogconf

.. code-block:: bash
   
   kubectl -n arcadia apply -f arcadia-ai-local-ingress-v2.yaml

.. code-block:: bash
   
   kubectl -n arcadia describe ingress


..  image:: ./_static/class2-8.png

Validate to ensure apps are protected.

Test by injecting a simple XSS attack into the header as shown. This simulate an attack to the Web application and will trigger attack mitigation from NGINX AppProtect. You should get a custom WAF block page as shown.

.. code-block:: bash

   <script>alert(1)</script>

..  image:: ./_static/class2-9.png

.. Note:: 
   NGINX App Protect offers additional capabilities to enhance the security of modern applications. Since this class focuses on securing GenAI applications, we will specifically address securing GenAI chatbots. While security logs can be forwarded to NGINX One SaaS or to an external syslog server and visualized with Grafana, we will not cover these as part of the lab exercises. For more information on using App Protect WAF, please refer to other NGINX labs.


4 - Recap
---------
1. You deploy NGINX Ingress Controller with App Protect to secure your modern application.
2. You deploy the Arcadia Financial microservices, which consist of multiple components: frontend, backend, money transfer, and refer-friend.
3. You expose Arcadia frontend using a Kubernetes (K8s) Ingress resource to allow access for users outside the Kubernetes cluster.
4. You verifed that you are able to access the site and successfully log in to the trading platform.
5. You successfully apply WAF protection to secure a modern application.
